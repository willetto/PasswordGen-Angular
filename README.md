# Password Generator Project

Project from [Modern Angular Bootcamp on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-angular-bootcamp/).

### What I Changed/Added

- Forced 'Enter Length' input to be a number input with a min and max.
- Set "Use Letters" to default to true and checked.
- CSS to keep widget off the top, fix some responsive issues from Bulma, and some personal flair.

### What I Learned

- [] | **Property Binding Syntax** | `[value]='variable'`
- () | **Event Binding Syntax** | `(event) = "method()" `
- {{ }} | **Interpolation** | Embeds expressions into marked up text

- **Structural Directive** | Adds or removes an HTML element based on some condition.
- **Attribute Directive** | Changes the properties of an HTML element it's applied to.

- Type checking has become stricter since this course was filmed, so I am having to use prior knowledge, the previous Q&A, and other documentation to problem solve type checking & setting.

- Used Bulma CSS Framework. This would have been really useful if we had been adding the framework classes to the markup along the way. I may use it for some quick projects in the future. I still added some of my own CSS in the component.css to add my own flair.
